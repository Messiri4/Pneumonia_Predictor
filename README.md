# Pneumonia Predictor

## Description
This is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project that can predict pneumonia using X-ray images. I created this model to learn the basic concepts of building a CNN model with TensorFlow.

## Setup Environment
### Dataset
[COVID19 X-ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets) 
has a total of 188 X-ray images. The dataset is split into two (train and test). 

This project was developed on google colab. Below is a list of instructions for importing datasets from google drive.
1. Download dataset from kaggle
2. Upload dataset to google drive
3. Mount google drive to google colab
