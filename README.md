# Pneumonia Predictor

## Description
This is a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project that can predict pneumonia using X-ray images. I created this model to learn the basic concepts of building a CNN model with TensorFlow.

## Setup Environment
### Dataset
[COVID19 X-ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets) 
has a total of 188 X-ray images. The dataset is split into two (train and test). 

This project was developed on google colab. Below is a list of instructions for importing datasets from google drive.
1. Download dataset from kaggle
2. Upload dataset to google drive
3. Import libraries
4. Mount google drive to google colab
5. Unzip file
6. Check if the directory exist
